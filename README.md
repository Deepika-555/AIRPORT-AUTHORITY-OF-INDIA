## AAI eCharting System â€“ Survey Charting & Management Platform
This project is developed for the Airport Authority of India (AAI) to manage and generate aeronautical survey charts in a more automated and scalable way. The system focuses on digitizing the entire charting process using spatial data from field surveys, integrating technologies like PostgreSQL with PostGIS, QGIS, SvelteKit, and Node.js.
 
## Objective
The main goal of this system is to provide a platform where survey data collected from various airports can be:

Organized and stored spatially,

Visualized through QGIS,

Converted into official e-charts,

Reviewed and managed from a modern web interface.

This significantly reduces manual work and ensures consistency and accuracy in chart creation.

# Key Modules & Features
Survey Data Ingestion: Upload and manage survey coordinates and related attributes through API endpoints.
PostGIS Integration: Store and process spatial/geographical data with PostgreSQL + PostGIS.
QGIS Chart Preparation: QGIS is used to fetch real-time data from the database and prepare chart layers for verification and export.
Modern Frontend: Built with SvelteKit, enabling fast rendering and a responsive UI for administrators and surveyors.
Role-Based Access: Admins, Survey Engineers, and Viewers have different permissions for accessing and modifying the data.
Backend Services: Developed with Node.js & Express, powering the API layer for CRUD operations and authentication.

# Technologies Used
Purpose	Stack
Frontend	SvelteKit (SPA with routing, stores, and component-driven UI)
Backend	Node.js, Express.js
Database	PostgreSQL + PostGIS
Charting Tool	QGIS (connected via DB layers)
Authentication	JWT & role-based middleware
Map Handling	QGIS + PostGIS integration
Deployment	(Environment specific â€“ not publicly hosted)

# How the System Works
Survey Data Entry â€“ Data is collected by surveyors and uploaded via APIs or forms.

Database Storage â€“ The data is stored in PostgreSQL with geospatial indexing via PostGIS.

QGIS Charting â€“ QGIS connects directly to the PostGIS database to render real-time chart layers.

Frontend Access â€“ Users log in via the SvelteKit app to view, edit, or verify the survey objects and charts.

Export â€“ Final charts are exported from QGIS and verified before being submitted.

ðŸ’¡ Key Learning & Contributions
As part of this project, I:

Worked closely with GIS engineers to integrate QGIS with PostgreSQL spatial layers.

Built RESTful APIs using Node.js for user management and data operations.

Designed a reactive frontend in SvelteKit with form handling, stores, and conditional routing.

Learned how to structure spatial data using PostGIS and connected it to QGIS for real-time chart rendering.

Contributed to chart export workflows and validation steps for official e-chart generation.


This project is currently used internally by the Airport Authority of India. All survey chart data and mapping layers are confidential and not publicly accessible.
